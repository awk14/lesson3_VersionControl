            <p class="lead">What is version control? Version control is a system that allows users to view previous versions of the project they are working on. A version control system is beneficial to a project because it allows you to see what you have done to get where you currently are. It also lets you revert back to the previous versions if need be. GitHub would be considered a Distributed Version Control System. When viewing your repository in GitHub, it full mirrors your local repository. It lets you collaborate with different groups simultaneously.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">"Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency." Git allows more than one person to work on a project on their local repository, and back it up to a remote repository. So every user has access to the repository locally and can save whenever they deem necessary. Git also will not allow the overwrite of a file on a shared repository. You can look at Git as a snapshot of your work. When you save your first version of your project or code, Git will hold on to that version, and each time you "push" to GitHub you can see the changes from the previous version to the current. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When working on your local repository (Cloud9) you can make changes and save as you go. But if you were working on a large scale project, and needed to go back to a previous stage of your project you may not be able to do so. Using a remote repository (GitHub) allows you to push your project from the local repository, taking a snapshot each time you push. Git uses different commands to access and manipulate your projects. For example, add allows you to track new files. And the commit command allows you to commit your changes. The benefits to using git are great because it the most efficient way to work on these kinds of projects.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are three states that your file can be in, commited, modified, or staged. Commited is the state of your file when you last ran the commit command, meaning your file is safely stored. Modified is the state of your file when you have modified your data but have yet to commit it. This file is located on your local repository. Staged is the state of your file when your changes have been finished, and it is marked to be committed. These three states are the basics of how Git works when it comes to managing and your projects. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Like the three states of Git there are also three main sections of a Git project, the Git directory, the working directory, and the staging area. The Git directory is where the metadata and object databases for your project are stored. It is where the copy of your local repository goes. The working directory is where files that you want to access from the Git directory go when you want to modify them. and Lastly, the staging area is where your files go after they have been modified and are preped for the commit command. Then they are sent off to the Git directory. These three sections are like a cycle. You modify your files in the working directory, the send them to the staging area to be prepared for the Git directory.</p>
